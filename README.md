# Distorted-tunnel

In TechCamp, we made a 3D rythm game for testing human reaction time using node.js and three.js libraries.
Ter√©k Zsolt was our field specific mentor, who introduces us the basic concepts of these technologies.
We only rendered the walls of the tunnels in which the player is currently moving and teleported the player back just the moment when it started to turn.
Thus, only a small part of the endless infinite tunnel needs to be rendered, yet the motion appears to be continuous.
